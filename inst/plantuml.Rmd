## A simple chart as png
```{plantuml diagram_png, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, plantuml.format = "png", plantuml.path = "graphs"}
left to right direction
actor "Food Critic" as fc
package Restaurant {
  usecase "Eat Food" as UC1
  usecase "Pay for Food" as UC2
  usecase "Drink" as UC3
}
fc --> UC1
fc --> UC2
fc --> UC3
```

## A simple chart as png and with code
```{plantuml diagram_png_code, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, plantuml.format = "png", plantuml.path = "graphs"}
left to right direction
actor "Food Critic" as fc
package Restaurant {
  usecase "Eat Food" as UC1
  usecase "Pay for Food" as UC2
  usecase "Drink" as UC3
}
fc --> UC1
fc --> UC2
fc --> UC3
```

## A simple chart as svg with code
```{plantuml diagram_svg, eval = TRUE, plantuml.format = "svg", plantuml.path = "graphs"}
robust "DNS Resolver" as DNS
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
DNS is Idle

@+100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@+200
WB is Waiting
WB -> DNS@+50 : Resolve URL

@+100

## Now only the code
```{plantuml code, eval = FALSE, plantuml.format = "png", plantuml.path = "graphs"}
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
